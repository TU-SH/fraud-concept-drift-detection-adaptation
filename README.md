**Adaptive Fraud Detection with Concept Drift Detection**

Demonstrates concept drift detection & automated model adaptation. 

---

**Project Overview**

Financial fraud patterns evolve over time - Attackers change tactics, transaction amounts shift, and new fraud vectors emerge. A static ML model trained once and left to run will silently degrade as the real world drifts away from its training distribution.

This project builds a **self-healing fraud detection system** that:

1. **Detects** when the data distribution has shifted (concept drift)
2. **Triggers** automated model retraining on fresh data
3. **Explains** which features changed most using SHAP
4. **Visualises** everything in a Streamlit dashboard

**Key Results**

| Metric        | Static Model | Adaptive Model | Improvement |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Mean ROC-AUC  | 0.686       | **0.974**      | +0.288      |
| Mean F1 Score | 0.370       | **0.891**      | +0.521      |
| Avg Precision | 0.386       | **0.916**      | +0.530      |

**The adaptive model retrained 5 times** and maintained high performance throughout all three temporal periods (pre-drift, post-drift, recovery), while the static model completely failed during the drift period (F1 → 0.07).

**Quick Start Guide**

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the full experiment
```bash
python run_experiment.py
```
This trains the baseline, streams all data, detects drift, retrains, and generates all plots in `reports/`.

### 3. Launch the dashboard
```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

### 4. Run tests
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

**Dataset**

A synthetic dataset with **40,000 transactions** across three temporal periods simulating realistic concept drift:

| Period       | Samples | Fraud Rate | What Changed                                |
|-------------|---------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| `pre_drift`  | 15,000  | 2.46%     | Fraud = low amounts, typical PCA features    |
| `post_drift` | 15,000  | 3.58%     | **Drift:** Fraud shifts to HIGH-value amounts; V1, V4 flip |
| `recovery`   | 10,000  | 2.98%     | Partial stabilisation of new fraud patterns  |

The dataset mimics the structure of the real-world [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) (28 PCA-transformed features + Amount).

**Drift Detection Methods**

Three complementary detectors run in parallel:

### ADWIN (Adaptive Windowing)
- Maintains two sub-windows and tests whether their means differ significantly
- Fast: O(log n) per update
- Good for: abrupt and gradual drift

### DDM (Drift Detection Method)
- Monitors the error rate mean (`p`) and standard deviation (`s`)
- Triggers warning when `p + s > p_min + 2 * s_min`
- Triggers drift when `p + s > p_min + 3 * s_min`
- Good for: error-rate based drift in classification

### Page-Hinkley Test
- Cumulative sum detector for persistent mean shifts
- Good for: detecting gradual monotonic drift in prediction errors

---

### Adaptive Retraining

When any detector fires:
1. The `AdaptiveRetrainer` accumulates recent samples in a **sliding window** (3,000 samples)
2. It fits a fresh `StandardScaler` and `XGBoost` on the buffered data
3. Before/after ROC-AUC is logged to `reports/retrain_log.csv`
4. The new model replaces the old one for subsequent predictions
5. Detectors are reset to begin monitoring the new baseline

## SHAP Explainability

After the experiment, SHAP TreeExplainer identifies which features changed most between the pre-drift and post-drift models:

- `Amount` — shifted from low to ~5× higher importance (fraud moved to high-value txns)
- `V21`, `V22`, `V15` — became less important as fraud patterns changed
- `V12`, `V16` — became more important in the post-drift model

This is the **"explainable drift"** angle — not just detecting that drift happened, but explaining *why* and *which features* drove it.
